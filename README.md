During the development I had some difficulties, because I am not so familiar with the frontend. My goal is to become a complete developer, working from **frontend** to **backend**.

## 🔧 Technical Skills
- Solid foundation in Java ☕️
- Fluent in Python/Flask 🐍
- Expertise in PHP/Laravel 🚀
- Proficient in relational databases 📊
- Web3 (HTML/CSS/JS)🌐

I am always eager to learn new things and possess the necessary discipline to achieve my goals.

**Open to exciting opportunities! 🌟**

Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch!
